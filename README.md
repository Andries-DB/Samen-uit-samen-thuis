# Samen uit, Samen thuis
## Final project for Mobdev I.

## Description:
Aggression of any kind has no place in society. That we can feel safe should be self-evident, as became apparent a few weeks ago during the protests in Ghent. As a training course, we do our part and create an application that provides outgoing people with a tool to take care of each other when things go wrong. We are making an application so that you are no longer alone, but with which you can intervene quickly and proactively as a group. In other words: out together, at home together.

## Installation:
1) NPM, NVM
2) Parcel
3) ESlint
4) Firebase
5) Netflify
6) Navigo

## Feature Overview

### Design System
A design system is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.

I've made a design system for my project. The themes I am using are:
1) Typography
2) Colors
3) Buttons
4) Forms
5) Card
6) Layout

My design system must ensure that I can reuse certain pieces of code. Everything is brought together on 1 page.
